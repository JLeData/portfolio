## Projects

#### **Capstone Project: Employee Turnover Prediction**
**Description:**  
This project is part of my Coursera Data Analytics Advanced course capstone, where I focused on predicting employee turnover at Salifort Motors using a dataset provided by Coursera. The goal was to identify patterns and factors that influence whether an employee stays or leaves, enabling the organization to take proactive steps in reducing turnover.

**Skills/Tools Used:**
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data visualization (Matplotlib)
- Logistic Regression (for binary classification)

**Key Insights/Results:**
- The model achieved an accuracy of 82%, with higher performance in predicting employees who would stay, but lower accuracy for predicting those who would leave.
- Identified factors such as job satisfaction, hours worked, and number of projects as significant indicators of employee turnover.
- The results can help management identify at-risk employees and take necessary actions to improve retention.
