# Data Analyst Portfolio
Hey! I’m Jordan. I started in accounting because I liked working with numbers, but a college project sparked my interest in data analytics. Through my work as a content analyst, I discovered I enjoy efficiency, problem-solving, organization, and min/maxing—aspects that drew me to inventory management. I’m looking to gain hands-on experience and pursue certifications to continue developing my skills and career. This is my portfolio, where I work on projects to deepen my expertise in inventory management.

## Projects

#### **Project Dool: OSRS Video Performance Analysis**
**Description:**
This project involved analyzing video data from OSRS content creators to help a small content creator optimize their strategy. Key areas of focus included:

- Video Length Optimization: Identifying the ideal video length for better viewer retention.
- Title Strategy for Episodic Content: Testing the impact of episodic titling on viewer retention.
- Upload and Content Scheduling: Analyzing upload timing and frequency to maintain consistent engagement.

The insights provided helped the creator refine their content strategy and reach a broader audience.

**Skills/Tools Used:**
- Python (Pandas, Numpy, re(Regular Expressions))
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (SQL)

**Key Insights/Results:**

- Ideal video length: 10-26 minutes, with 14-16 minutes being optimal for engagement, and up to 26 minutes providing flexibility for more content.
- Found that episodic titling boosts viewer retention.
- Improved upload schedule to align with other content creators for consistent engagement.

#### **Capstone Project: Employee Turnover Prediction**
**Description:**  
This project is part of my Coursera Data Analytics Advanced course capstone, where I focused on predicting employee turnover at Salifort Motors using a dataset provided by Coursera. The goal was to identify patterns and factors that influence whether an employee stays or leaves, enabling the organization to take proactive steps in reducing turnover.

**Skills/Tools Used:**
- Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Logistic Regression (for binary classification)

**Key Insights/Results:**
- The model achieved an accuracy of 82%, with higher performance in predicting employees who would stay, but lower accuracy for predicting those who would leave.
- Identified factors such as job satisfaction, hours worked, and number of projects as significant indicators of employee turnover.
- The results can help management identify at-risk employees and take necessary actions to improve retention.
